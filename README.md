# Project2
I have learnt a lot from this project. First of all I learn how to used github as a collaborative tools in websites' development. 
Secondly I have learnt a lot from my teamates. Finally I became more user-centered when developping a webpage. However, I still need to learn a lot on responsive design. I enjoyed working on this project with  my team.
